# Nietypowa Sowa (Final version)

## About

I would like to introduce you to one of my website commercial projects, where I built the whole thing using the React framework.

This is a site dedicated to an artist who airbrush paints professionally, creating custom helmets, motorbike tanks, etc. To build it, I used a mockup created by my designer [Kamila L](https://github.com/KamiRaLsr). The website allows you to browse the offer, look at photos of the work in the gallery, and contact via a form using a user-friendly UI.

## Coding & Problems

I did not encounter any major problems when writing the code due to the use of components from the previous version and the [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) library.
